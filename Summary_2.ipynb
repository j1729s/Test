    "SWAPS would be the analogy to a traditional measure of Order Flow because it tells us about the supply and demand dynamics of the asset. However, in this case that's easier said than done. Because one can buy PT using any coin eg. ETH or DAI or anything on the Pendle Platform. And similarly for YT. Therefore, PT and YT are not dualistics in nature at least in the supply and demand way of things. That is to say that the data might indicate that both PT and YT are in high demand. And just because people are buying a lot of PT does not mean they are selling a lot of YT. As would have been the case for a transaction for BTCUSDT in a CEX. So what I have done is that I treat both PT and YT as seperate instruments almost and calculate the buy/sell pressure on each one as such:\n",
